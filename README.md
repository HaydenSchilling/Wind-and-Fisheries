Data and Code for Wind and Fisheries Analysis

This repository goes with Schilling et al. and provides all the data and code to replicate this study

All analysis was conducted in R v3.6.1 with some initial data processing done using a HPC. The scripts are all writen to be run with the "Scripts" folder as the working directory.

All wind data is from two publically available reanalysis models, the Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2049-2019) and the NOAA-CIRES Twentieth Century Reanalysis (V2c) (https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.20thC_ReanV2c.html). Scripts used to extract the specific data can be found in this repository along with copies of the final processed data which was used for all modelling.
